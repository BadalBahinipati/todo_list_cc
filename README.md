TODO List skill test solution-Coding Ninjas

Task: To create a TODO page using Vanilla JS - no plugins or imported libraries.

Approach: I created the entire webpage using pure script of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here are the steps I followed:-
a. HTML-
    - Create a header text: TODO PLANNER
    - Create a 'New Task' section which woul contain a text input field and an 'Add' button to create a new task.
    - Below the 'New Task' section is the 'To Do' section listing pending tasks. This section contains two buttons:
        i. Edit button to edit the tasks. 1st click lets us edit the task which can be saved when the Edit button is clicked again
        ii. Delete button to delete the tasks.
      There are also checkboxes just in case we need multiple selections.
    - The final section is the 'Completed' sectionnwhere the tasks completed are listed. They are striked out visual ascetics and can be 
      deleted as well.

b. CSS-
    Styling has been done using omponents such as text-align, color etc. without any use of additional libraries.

c. Javascript- Coding done without importing external plugins
